# weather-modelling
The objective of this experiment is to simulate a weather modeling scenario by solving quadratic equations  𝑎 𝑥 2 + 𝑏 𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0 ax  2  +bx+c=0 under different input conditions. This experiment demonstrates problem-solving in stages, focusing on code modularity and input/output handling in C.
